# Lunar-Lander-Deep_Q_Learning
## Description

This repository contains a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) implementation for the classic Atari game "Lunar Lander". The project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent to successfully land on the moon. The code is based on the "Artificial Intelligence A-Z 2023: Build 5 AI (incl. ChatGPT)" course from Udemy, providing a practical example of applying AI in a gaming context.

## Code Explanation

The script includes the following key components:

- **Library Import**: Essential libraries such as `os`, `random`, `numpy`, `torch`, and others are imported for neural network operations and array manipulations.

- **Neural Network Architecture**: The `NN` class defines the neural network structure, crucial for the Deep Q-Learning process. It sets up fully connected layers for a feedforward neural network.

- **Initial Configuration**: Parameters for the state size, action size, and randomness seed are initialized, forming the basis of the neural network's learning capability.

- **Training Mechanism**: The script is expected to contain the training loop, loss function, and optimizer, essential for training the agent in the "Lunar Lander" game.
